## About Me
Hi, I'm Yu-Huan Wang. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Sangjin Kim](https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/sangjin). I use single-particle tracking and super-resolution imaging technique to study the spatiotemporal properties of DNA loci and proteins in living bacterial cells. You can learn more about our research at [Kim Lab Website](https://www.sjkimlab.org/).
